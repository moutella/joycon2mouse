# joycon2py

A lightweight Python script that turns the Joy-Con 2's and the Pro Controller 2 into working PC Controllers.

---
## LOOK! NEW STUFF!
Theres a new version of the project, here!  
https://github.com/TheFrano/joycon2py/tree/cpp  
It's a C++ rewrite of the entire project, to implement Gyro/Mouse using a DS4 controller. Check it out!  

## DISCLAIMER

This project is **Windows-only**, primarily because `vgamepad` (used for virtual controller output) is exclusive to Windows.  
You're free to make your own macOS/Linux fork if you want.

Supported controllers:  
Joy-Con 2: Full support  
Pro Controller 2: Full support  
NSO GC Controller: Semi support (Joysticks confirmed to work, buttons may not be mapped/mapped correctly in code yet, requires data sent over by someone with one)  

If the program crashes, it means it couldn't connect to your joycon, often caused by:  
1. Disconnecting and connecting in a short amount of time. Fix - Wait a little before reconnecting them
2. Pairing through a button press - this never works, please use the Sync button as directed by the program

## Will there be GYRO or MOUSE support?

Their data WAS found, however vgamepad can't use the data. If you want this, check out the C++ version at the top.

## DEPENDENCIES

- Python (3.7+)
- [`bleak`](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak)  
  ‚Üí `pip install bleak`  
- [`vgamepad`](https://github.com/yannbouteiller/vgamepad)  
  ‚Üí `pip install vgamepad`  
  ‚Üí Requires [ViGEmBus drivers](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest) installed

---

## How do I use it?
- Download the whole repo (green button titled code, press download zip. you can delete readme.md if you want)
- Open the main.py script (dont open the other scripts those are modules)
- Pick your amount of players
- Pick everyone's controller
- If using a singular joycon you'll be asked if its Left or Right
- If using dual joycons itll ask you to pair one joycon then the other
- If using a pro controller/gc controller it just asks you to pair it
- When its all done, you'll have SDL controllers ready for every player to use.

- If the controller disconnects, the code will (eventually) notice the disconnection, and promptly wait for you to reconnect your controller. You do this by, again, holding down your sync button.

> üí° Note: Bit layouts differ slightly between left and right Joy-Cons, so correct side pairing is important.

# Joy-Con 2 BLE Notification Research

This document outlines some findings related to Joy-Con 2 BLE input behavior. If you're developing or reverse-engineering Joy-Con 2, Pro Controller 2, or other supported Nintendo controllers over BLE, this may be useful.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Behavior Quirks

A notable quirk of these controllers is that if you attempt to connect or pair them repeatedly in a short time span, they may stop responding or fail to connect entirely for several minutes. This appears to be a controller-level cooldown behavior rather than an OS/BLE stack issue.

**If your controller stops connecting:**  
Wait a few minutes before trying again. It should recover on its own.

## üîî BLE Notification (with IMU enabled, Left Joy-Con)

Here‚Äôs an example notification received from a Joy-Con 2 via BLE, with the IMU command sent. (Pro Controller 2 and GC Controller notifications follow similar layouts but may shift certain fields.)

08670000000000e0ff0ffff77f23287a0000000000000000000000000000005f0e007907000000000001ce7b52010500beffb501ee0ffeff04000200000000


### Field Breakdown (based on known Joy-Con 2 layout)

### üìò Notes

- Left Joy-Con **does not use Right Stick**, so data at `0x0B‚Äì0x0D` is typically junk.
- **Stick values** use 12-bit X/Y packed across 3 bytes:
  - X = upper 12 bits of first 1.5 bytes
  - Y = lower 12 bits of next 1.5 bytes
- **Accel/Gyro** fields are signed 16-bit:
  - Accelerometer: `4096 = 1G`
  - Gyroscope: `48000 = 360¬∞/s`
- **Temperature**:  
  `25¬∞C + (raw / 127)`  
  ‚Üí `25 + (3679 / 127) ‚âà 54¬∞C`
- **Battery voltage**:  
  Reported as millivolts. `3000` = 3.0V. If `0x0000`, likely unavailable at that time.
