# Nintendo Switch 2 JoyCon as Mouse

Software to use your joy-con 2 on Mac as mouse. I intend to make it a fully customizable software, but for now, all you can do is connect a right joy con and use it as a mouse

## Special Thanks! 
I was only able to do this because of [the original joycon2py by  TheFrano](https://github.com/TheFrano/joycon2py/)

Some more info I used was provided in [german77's joycon driver](https://github.com/german77/JoyconDriver)
